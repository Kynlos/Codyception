## Getting Started

To get started with Codyception, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/codyception.git
cd codyception
# Open the index.html file in your default web browser (see below for info on how to run this locally and not on a web-server)
```
### Running Locally

**Note:** You will need to run a basic web-server if you are running this locally.  To do this, you can use any of the following methods:

#### With npm

```bash
npm i http-server -g
cd src/
http-server
```

#### With Python

Create a new file called `cody-srv.py` (this needs to be in the same folder as your `index.html` file), and paste the following code:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver

port = 8000

handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

with socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler) as httpd:
    print(f"Serving on port {port}")

    try:
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nServer stopped by user.")
```
Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder with this script, type `python cody-srv.py` and then navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000` - This will now give you access to all the javascript within the site.


## Usage

**Enter Command Details:** Fill in the command name and prompt in the provided input fields.

**Select Context Options:** Choose the context in which your command should operate by selecting from the available options.

**Create Command:** Click the "Create Command" button to generate a .json file with your command details.
